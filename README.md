# pgR-Sample-Data-Analysis
The code constructs an undirected graph from a hardcoded set of edges and applies the Sloan ordering algorithm to optimize the layout of a sample graph derived from pgRouting test data.
The goal is to compare the effectiveness of Sloan ordering against the natural vertex ordering in terms of bandwidth and profile, two important metrics in sparse matrix reordering and graph layout optimization.
Output for the generated unidirected graph:
